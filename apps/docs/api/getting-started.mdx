## Quick Start

Run your first API request:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  "https://api.usenotra.com/v1/YOUR_ORGANIZATION_ID/posts/"
```

<Tip>
  Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your API key and `YOUR_ORGANIZATION_ID` with your
  organization ID.
</Tip>

## Creating an API Key

<Steps>
<Step title="Open your workspace settings">
  Open your workspace dashboard, then click **Settings** in the sidebar.
</Step>

<Step title="Go to API Keys">Click on **API Keys** at the bottom of the sidebar.</Step>

<Step title="Create a new key">
  Click **Create API Key**, give it a descriptive name (e.g., "Production
  Website"), and select the appropriate permissions. You can also set an
  expiration date.
</Step>

<Step title="Copy your key">
  Your API key will only be shown once. Copy it and store it securely.
</Step>
</Steps>

API keys are powered by [Unkey](https://unkey.com/).

<Warning>
  Keep API keys private. Even read-only keys can be abused and burn through your
  [rate limits](/api/rate-limits) if exposed in client-side code. Use server-side
  requests whenever possible.
</Warning>

## Authentication

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header using the `Bearer` scheme:

```javascript
const response = await fetch(
  "https://api.usenotra.com/v1/YOUR_ORGANIZATION_ID/posts/",
  {
  headers: {
      Authorization: "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY",
    },
  },
