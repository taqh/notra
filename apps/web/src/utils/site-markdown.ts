    question: "What is Notra and who is it for?",
    answer:
      "Notra is a content automation tool for product and engineering teams. Connect your GitHub repos and Notra picks up merged PRs and shipped features to draft changelogs, blog posts, and social updates.",
  },
  {
    question: "What kind of content does Notra generate?",
    answer:
      "Changelog entries from merged PRs, blog post drafts when you ship features, and social updates when you hit milestones. Every draft matches your brand voice so it reads like your team wrote it.",
  },
  {
    question: "Which integrations are available right now?",
    answer:
      "The beta ships with GitHub. Connect your repos and Notra starts pulling in PRs, commits, and releases right away. Linear, Slack, and more are on the roadmap.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does brand voice matching work?",
    answer:
      "During setup you provide a few examples of your existing content. Notra learns your tone, vocabulary, and style so every draft sounds like your team wrote it.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is my data secure with Notra?",
    answer:
      "Integration tokens are encrypted at rest. Your source code is never stored. Notra only reads the metadata it needs to write drafts, like PR titles, descriptions, and commit messages.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is there a free tier?",
    answer:
      "There is no permanent free tier. When you sign up, an automatic Basic trial is applied for 7 days at no cost so you can explore Notra before committing to a paid plan.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I get started?",
    answer:
      "Sign up, connect your GitHub, and Notra starts generating content within minutes. Your 7-day Basic trial begins automatically.",
