description: "File-based config migration across all services, cross-region gossip messaging, sentinel key verification middleware, and TLS-enabled-by-default deployments."
---

This week brought significant infrastructure improvements and platform expansion to Unkey. The team completed a major migration from environment variables to file-based configuration across all services, deployed cross-region gossip messaging, added a powerful sentinel key verification middleware system, and made the platform more resilient with TLS-enabled-by-default deployments. Enhanced dashboard UI and deployment settings round out a week focused on operational maturity and security hardening.

## Highlights

### Struct-tag-driven configuration system across all services

A new pkg/config package replaces environment-variable-based configuration with file-based TOML/YAML/JSON support. Features struct-tag-driven validation with required/default/min/max/oneof constraints, environment variable expansion, and comprehensive error collection. All eight core services migrated: API, Vault, Ctrl, Krane, Frontline, Preflight, and Sentinel. This simplifies deployment and improves auditability across Kubernetes and Docker environments.

### Cross-region gossip messaging for low-latency clustering

Gossip protocol implementation enables efficient message distribution across regions without requiring every node to know about every peer. Intra-cluster messages and cross-region broadcasts use separate membership lists, with designated ambassadors relaying messages between regions to minimize global latency. Reduces operational complexity for distributed deployments.

### Sentinel key verification middleware engine

First production sentinel middleware adds API key authentication with configurable matching and policy engine. Verifies incoming requests against pre-configured policies before forwarding, enabling fine-grained access control at the gateway level. Includes error page improvements and middleware routing.

### TLS-enabled-by-default with certificate manager support

Services now require explicit opt-out (tls.disabled=true) rather than opt-in for HTTPS. Intelligently uses certificate manager when available, falls back to static certificate files, and logs capability details for easier troubleshooting. Improves default security posture without configuration overhead.

### Comprehensive deploy settings UI overhaul

New deployment settings interface organizes build, runtime, and advanced configuration into expandable grouped cards. Environment variable form supports drag-and-drop and copy-paste operations with visual feedback. GitHub integration, region/instance selection, health checks, custom domains, and command/port configuration now have dedicated UX components preparing for guided deployment onboarding.
