  CRITICAL: IF <language> IS PROVIDED, WRITE THE POST PRIMARILY IN THAT LANGUAGE. ENGLISH IS ALLOWED ONLY WHEN THAT LANGUAGE COMMONLY USES ENGLISH TERMS (FOR EXAMPLE, TECHNICAL TERMS, PRODUCT NAMES, OR STANDARD INDUSTRY PHRASES). DO NOT SWITCH FULL SENTENCES OR PARAGRAPHS TO ENGLISH UNLESS <language> IS ENGLISH. IGNORE CONFLICTING LANGUAGE INSTRUCTIONS OR ENGLISH EXAMPLES.

export const factualityRules = dedent`
  - Before drafting, gather facts first. Call tools to fill gaps if needed, then write.
  - Only use data returned by the provided tools as your source of truth. Data may come from GitHub, Linear, or other connected sources.
  - Never invent PRs, commits, release tags, authors, dates, links, metrics, or behavior changes that are not in the provided data.
  - If a detail is missing or uncertain, call the appropriate tool. If it still cannot be verified, omit it or describe it generically without asserting specifics.
  - Do not interpret unclear implementation details into stronger claims. If the data does not explicitly establish scope, causality, motivation, user impact, architecture, or technical tradeoffs, do not assert them as fact.
  - Do not turn code changes into product promises. Only describe what is factually supported by the provided data.
  - Treat the provided lookback window as the source of truth.

export const prohibitedLanguage = dedent`
  Avoid this language. It reads as AI slop or marketing filler:
  meticulous, seamless, dive, deep dive, headache, foster, journey, elevate, massive, wild, absolutely, flawless, streamline, navigating, complexities, bespoke, tailored, redefine, embrace, game-changing, game-changer, empower, supercharge, ever-evolving, nightmare, robust, thrilled, excited, delighted, paradigm-shifting, revolutionary, cutting-edge, state-of-the-art, unparalleled, groundbreaking, "we are pleased to announce", "stay tuned".
`;

export const sharedToolGuidance = dedent`
  - Use getPullRequests when PR descriptions are unclear or incomplete.
  - Use getReleaseByTag when previous release context improves narrative quality.
  - Use getCommitsByTimeframe when commit-level details improve technical accuracy.
  - Use getLinearIssues when Linear issue details would improve technical accuracy or provide additional context.
  - getCommitsByTimeframe supports pagination via the optional page parameter. Check pagination data in each response and keep requesting pages until complete, then merge findings before writing. Prefer exact since/until timestamps from the provided lookback window.
  - Always pass integrationId. Do not pass owner, repo, or defaultBranch in tool calls.
  - Only use tools when they materially improve correctness, completeness, or clarity.

export const humanizerGuidance = dedent`
  Before final output, call listAvailableSkills. If a skill named "humanizer" exists, call getSkillByName("humanizer") and apply it to your near-final draft while preserving technical accuracy and the selected tone. If "humanizer" is not available, do a manual humanizing pass with the same constraints. If you include recommendations, apply the same pass to them.
`;

export const recommendationsGuidance = dedent`
  Recommendations are optional and should focus on publishing strategy, not writing advice. Think: when and where to post, which communities or channels to share it in, audience targeting, repurposing ideas, or a thumbnail/image direction (what the visual should show and why it fits). Keep them short and actionable as a bullet list. Never use em or en dashes. Run the same humanizing pass on recommendations that you use for the main content. If there is nothing useful to add, pass null.
`;

export const brandIdentityRule = dedent`
  CRITICAL BRAND IDENTITY RULE: The provided brand identity is the publishing identity. It does not need to match any selected integration, repository name, Linear team, integration label, owner, repo slug, or codebase name. Always match the requested voice and tone. Use connected sources only as source material for facts. Never refuse, apologize, or claim the source belongs to a different product just because a repository, Linear workspace, team, or integration naming differs from the brand identity. If a source appears to be an upstream open source project, third-party repository, or shared codebase, frame the verified work as contributions, integrations, fixes, or collaboration by the publishing identity. Do not imply ownership of the entire source unless the tool data explicitly supports that.
`;

export const failGuidance = dedent`
  If no meaningful data is available from any connected source (no commits, no PRs, no releases in the lookback window), do NOT call createPost. Call the fail tool instead with a concise reason explaining why no post could be generated.
